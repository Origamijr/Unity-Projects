# Unity-Projects

## Gou da Cheese
My introduction to Unity + Blender. Simple animated character movement and actions and inventory system.

## Del Operator
Random attempt at grid based movement.

## Hex Grid
Experimentation with cubic representation of hex grids. Supports basic A* algorithm for a linear looking pathfinder.

## Cut'n Corner (You Cut I Choose)
Small turn based asymmetric minigame created for School's gam jam inspired by the "You Cut I Choose" conflict resolution. Involves two players: the edgelord and the ghost. The ghost collects points by wlaking on point tiles, while the edgelord chooses where to place a fence after the ghost moves. The game is over when the ghost is cornered.
